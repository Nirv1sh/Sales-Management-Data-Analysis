# Sales-Management-Data-Analysis
My name is Nirvish, and I am currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Big Data Analytics from Trent University. This is the first project I’ve created to showcase in my Data Analyst portfolio. 

# Business Request & User Stories
The business request for this data analyst project was an executive sales report for sales managers. Based on the request that was made from the business we following user stories were defined to fulfill delivery and ensure that acceptance criteria’s were maintained throughout the project.

# Data Wrangling and Transformation
To develop the essential data model for analysis and to meet the business requirements outlined in the user stories, the following tables were extracted using SQL.
An Excel file containing sales budgets served as one of the data sources and was integrated into the data model in a subsequent phase of the process.
Presented below are the SQL statements used for data cleansing and transformation.

# Data Model
Here’s a visual representation of the data model after the cleaned and prepared tables have been imported into Power BI. This model illustrates the connections between FACT_Budget, FACT_InternetSales, and the essential DIM tables.
